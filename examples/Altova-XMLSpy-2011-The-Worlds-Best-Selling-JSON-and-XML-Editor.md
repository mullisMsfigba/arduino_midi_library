## How to create and edit JSON documents and schemas
 
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. JSON is widely used for web applications, APIs, and data exchange.
 
XMLSpy 2011 supports JSON editing in both text and graphical views. You can create a new JSON document from scratch or from an existing XML document or schema. You can also import JSON data from a file or URL.
 
To create a new JSON document from scratch, select File > New > JSON Document. You can then enter the JSON data in the text view or switch to the graphical view to use the entry-helpers and drag-and-drop functionality. You can also use the JSON Schema View to create or edit a JSON schema that defines the structure and constraints of your JSON document.
 
To create a new JSON document from an existing XML document or schema, select File > Convert > XML to JSON. You can then choose the source XML file or schema and the target JSON file or schema. XMLSpy 2011 will automatically convert the XML data to JSON format, preserving the structure and semantics as much as possible. You can also customize the conversion options, such as using arrays or objects for repeating elements, using attributes or child elements for properties, and using namespaces or prefixes for keys.
 
To import JSON data from a file or URL, select File > Open > Open URL/File. You can then enter the URL or browse for the file that contains the JSON data. XMLSpy 2011 will open the JSON document in the text or graphical view, depending on your preference.
