Although Tally has launched newer versions of its software, such as TallyPrime and Tally ERP 9, some users may still prefer to use Tally 7.2 for various reasons. For example, some users may find Tally 7.2 easier to use, or they may have customized solutions developed for Tally 7.2 that are not compatible with newer versions.
 
If you are one of those users who want to use Tally 7.2 for educational purposes, you may be wondering how to download it for free. Unfortunately, Tally does not offer a free version of Tally 7.2 on its official website[^1^]. However, there are some third-party websites that claim to provide Tally 7.2 free download links[^2^]. But before you download anything from these websites, you should be aware of the risks involved.
 
## Risks of Downloading Tally 7.2 from Unofficial Sources
 
Downloading Tally 7.2 from unofficial sources may expose you to several risks, such as:
 
- Virus or malware infection: The files you download may contain malicious code that can harm your computer or steal your data.
- Legal issues: You may be violating the intellectual property rights of Tally Solutions by downloading their software without their permission or license.
- Lack of support: You may not get any technical support or updates from Tally Solutions if you use an unofficial version of their software.
- Lack of features: You may miss out on the latest features and enhancements that are available in the newer versions of Tally software.

Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you do not download Tally 7.2 from unofficial sources. Instead, you should consider using the free accounting software offered by Tally Solutions on their website[^3^].
